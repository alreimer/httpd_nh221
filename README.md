this is a web-user-interface for 'one user', so called -> root.
I am using this program on my NAS (allnet ALL6260). But it can be modified for other NASes.

The configuration of NAS is fully controlled by this program and can be used on old versions of Browsers.
It takes small size of memory, and is made for configure as closer as possible to linux.
(like configure /etc/smb.conf file, or /etc/passwd file)
